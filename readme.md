## Build

You may want to build Capybara from source if
- You are not using one of the supported OS (Windows, macOS, major flavors of Linux), or
- You have made some changes to the source code.


First, clone or create the project directory and
```
cd Capybara-app
```

Capybara includes a `Pipfile` specifying all requirements, generated by the virtual environment management tool Pipenv. Install Pipenv if you don't have it alreday:
```
pip install pipenv
```

Next, build the Pipenv virtual environment and install the requirements from `Pipfile`. Be sure that you already have Python 3.6 installed on your system. If you have multiple versions of Python, this command will automatically search for Python 3.6.
```
pipenv install
```

Then, you can execute the main script directly:
```
pipenv run python main.py
```


Alternatively, you can build and run the binary:
```
pipenv install -d
pipenv run python -OO -m PyInstaller main.py -F
dist/./main
```
For Windows 10 users: you also need to install pywin32-ctypes with `pipenv install pywin32-ctypes`.

Note that, although Pipenv automatically scans for the targeted Python version (Python 3.6), this may not give the desired result if you have multiple implementations of Python (for instance, CPython 3.6.8 and PyPy 3.6.9). In this case, you can specify the path to the correct Python version, for example:
```
pipenv --python /usr/bin/python3.6
```
